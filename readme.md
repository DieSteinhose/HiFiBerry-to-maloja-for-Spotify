# Spotify HiFiBerryOS to Maloja

This addresses a niche problen. The implementation that [HiFiBerryOS](https://github.com/hifiberry/hifiberry-os) uses for Spotify Connect does not report the last listened songs back to Spotify, so these songs do not show up in Maloja.

This program solves the problem, is a temporary workaround until the [issue](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/issues/913) in [librespot](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot) is solved.

## TODO

- [ ] Ready to use Docker Container
- [ ] In rare cases a song is not scobbled
